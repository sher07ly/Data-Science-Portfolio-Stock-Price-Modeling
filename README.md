Hello, welcome to my portfolio!ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains a collection of projects focused on stock price prediction using various data analysis and predictive modeling methods. These projects were created to hone skills in processing financial data, analyzing stock price movements, creating data visualizations, building predictive models, and determining stock price predictions.

Some of the techniques and models used in this portfolio include:
âœ… Time Series Analysis
âœ… Deterministic Models
âœ… Modifying deterministic models into stochastic models
âœ… Prophet Method
âœ… Visualising stock price trends and patterns

All projects are aimed at understanding stock market behavior and developing the ability to predict stock prices based on historical data.
